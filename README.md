# Create React UI Lib

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-react-ui-lib.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-ui-lib)

A CLI tool that bootstraps simple [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) template for painless [React](https://reactjs.org/) UI library development.

- Unopinionated: no default styling, mandatory ESLint, pre-commit hooks â€” bring your own stuff if you need it.
- Type definitions are extracted using [vite-plugin-dts](https://github.com/qmhc/vite-plugin-dts).
- Bundles to ES and UMD modules, generates sourcemaps.
- Uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) or [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) for docs which are easily deployed as GitHub pages.
- Optional ESLint with recommended settings for each of these plugins: [typescript](https://typescript-eslint.io/), [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier), [react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react), [react-hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), [jsx-a11y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).

- [Set up GitHub pages for this project](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) to build from `docs` folder from `main` branch.
  - To do this go to this repo's settings and open `Pages` section (menu on the left side). Select `Source` -> `Deploy from a branch`, select `Branch` -> `main` and `/docs` folder.
